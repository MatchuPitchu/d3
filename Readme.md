# Understanding D3 & Data Visualization

- Data visualization
  - is the ability to convey a story or an idea as efficiently as possible
  - makes it easy to identify certain patterns or disruptions in data
  - made up of shapes, size and color

## D3 (Data Driven Documents)

- helps to close gap between data and visualization on the web
- helps to calculate size, shape, color and position

- `Data`
  - JSON, CSV, plain text etc.
  - data should drive the visualization; NOT other way around
- `Document`
  - HTML webpage
  - represents the data; the visual will depend on the data itself and not dictate what the data should be

## SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)

- regular images based on pixels are `JPG`, `JPEG`, `PNG`, `BMP`, `GIF`
- vector images generated and manipulated with code are `SVG`
  - vectors are created using math equations and commands
