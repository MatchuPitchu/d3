    <h1>Linear Scale</h1>
    <p>This scale is not the best scale for our dataset.</p>
    <p>
      Problem: linear scale transforms continuous scale into continuous (100 different data points to 100 different
      colors) -> hard to read.
    </p>
    <p>Better solution: using other scale to transform into discrete output scale (limited number of colors).</p>

    <h1>Quantize Scale</h1>
    <p>
      The continuous input domain is divided into uniform segments (here: 3 buckets) based on the number of values in
      the output range.
    </p>
    <div class="chart" id="heatmap-2"></div>

    <h1>Quantile Scale</h1>
    <p>
      In contrast to the quantize scale, this takes the number (!) of values of input domain and divides them into equal
      parts, each with the same number of values.
    </p>
    <p>Scale is not useful at all in this case.</p>
    <div class="chart" id="heatmap-3"></div>

    <h1>Threshold Scale</h1>
    <p>
      Threshold scales are similar to quantize scales, except they allow you to map arbitrary subsets of the domain to
      discrete values in the range. The input domain is still continuous, and divided into slices based on a set of
      threshold values.
    </p>
    <p>Best data representation because threshold for household incomes are based on research.</p>
